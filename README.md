## Beth Skurrie

I spend most of my free time working on the open source [Pact](https://pact.io) project (when the weather is bad), or out in the garden (when the weather is good).

I'm a diehard Ruby developer, but like everyone these days, I haven't been able to avoid learning Javascript, and I originally came from a Java background.

My work with Pact lead me to to co-found [pactflow.io](https://pactflow.io) with my long term colleagues and co-maintainers Matt Fellows and Ron Holshausen, and my long term (12 years!) employer, [DiUS](https://dius.com.au) in 2019. Pactflow was bought by SmartBear in 2022.
